## Key Features of Our Development Workflow

1. **Fork-Based Development**
   - Work on personal forks for isolation
   - Maintain clean separation between contributors

2. **Branch Naming Conventions**
   - `feature/` for new capabilities
   - `fix/` for bug fixes
   - `blog/` for content additions

3. **Automated Preview Deployments**
   - GitHub Actions automatically deploy branch changes
   - Preview on GitHub Pages before merging

4. **Pull Request Integration**
   - Code review process for quality control
   - Collaborative improvement before merging

## Benefits of This Approach

This development workflow ensures that:

- Changes are isolated and testable
- Multiple contributors can work simultaneously
- All changes are reviewed before going live
- The main website remains stable
